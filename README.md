- Download the Settings.zip
- Go to the RDR2 settings folder: "C:\Users\[YOUR USER]\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Settings"
- Delete all the files that already have this folder, just make a backup of the file <system.xml> for next step
- Copy the content of the folder Settings you've been unzipped and paste in the next route of your computer: "C:\Users\[YOUR USER]\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Settings"
- Open <system.xml> that you already copyed
- Open <system.xml> that you already made a backup

The Graphic Card Brand and Model need to looks like <NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060> for NVIDIA Users or <AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT> for AMD Users, just edit this line for your model, copy your model from the <system.xml> backup and paste into <system.xml> that already are in the settings folder of RDR2.

This works for me, I found the steps on Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRedDead/comments/12ocdmb/comment/jgt64vd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button>

Due to the nature of the problem, it might not be a definitive solution, and what worked for me may not work for you, but at least it is an attempt.
